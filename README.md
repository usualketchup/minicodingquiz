## Description
This application is short coding quiz using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery to allow the user to take a short quiz on some fundamental coding questions.
When the user clicks on each question on the quiz, a new question will pop up and moves on to the next question. The background of the option changes depending on whether or not the user got the option choice right or wrong.

## Challenges
I faced a lot of problems while creating this application because it took so long for me to gain a proper understanding of Javascript and Jquery while doing this assignment. I spent so much time trying to figure out exactly how to get everything to disappear while I was making the quiz. After a fair amount of hard work and looking through online resources, I finally figured out how to work through a lot of the provided code!
